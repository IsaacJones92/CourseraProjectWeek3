Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The script works by having the information found at the following url in your R working directory: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

If done correctly, when you run the attached script (run_analysis.R) will do the following:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

This tidy data set will write to a csv file titled tidy.csv
